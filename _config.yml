# This file is used by GitHub Pages to configure how your site is built and served.
# It helps resolve issues where HTML files are served as raw text (text/plain)
# instead of being rendered by the browser.

# We are using the default theme to leverage Jekyll's core functionality
# without needing complex setup.
theme: jekyll-theme-cayman

# Explicitly exclude common source file formats that could interfere
# with the rendering process if they are misinterpreted.
exclude:
  - Gemfile
  - Gemfile.lock
  - node_modules
  - vendor/

# Force the site to rebuild with the correct configuration settings.
